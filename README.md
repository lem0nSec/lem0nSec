# Hi! ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a certified Penetration Tester and Red Teamer who is passionate about offensive low-level programming, reverse engineering, and binary exploitation.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning and developing new code for my own education.

- âš¡ I spend most of my spare time developing in C and Assembly in Windows environments.


```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  printf("Hello Lemons!\n");
  return 0;
}
