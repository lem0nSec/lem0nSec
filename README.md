# Hi! ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a certified Penetration Tester and Red Teamer who is passionate about offensive low-level programming, reverse engineering, and binary exploitation.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning and developing new code for my own education.
- âš¡ I spend most of my spare time developing in C and Assembly in Windows environments (very old school).
